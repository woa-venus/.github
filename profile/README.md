# Windows on Xiaomi Mi 11

We host several repositories containing resources used to provide working ARM64 Windows on the Xiaomi Mi 11

Most of the stuff you will find here is based on work of [WOA Project](https://github.com/WOA-Project), [Project Aloha](https://github.com/Project-Aloha) and [Project Silicium](https://github.com/Project-Silicium)
